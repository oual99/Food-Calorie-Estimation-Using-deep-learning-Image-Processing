# Food-Calorie-Estimation-Using-deep-learning-Image-Processing
In this project, we tried to realize a deep learning application for the classification and recognition of foods, and an implementation of some methods of image segmentation whose aim is to give an estimate of the weight of a food in an image taken by the user. To achieve such a result, the goal of this work is to achieve the following objectives: 
#### 1. Create a CNN-type neural network for meal recognition from a captured image. 
#### 2. Find a way to estimate the number of calories in a meal from a picture.
